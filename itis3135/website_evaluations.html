                    <p>
                        Argren Electronics is a Norweigian Electronics company that was founded
                        in 1983. They mostly sell gadgets such as bikes, dune buggies,
                        scooters etc. They are widely known for how terrible there website is, being
                        ranked as one of the worst websites of 2020 on multiples pages. 
                    </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Constrast</li>
                            <li>Repitition</li>
                            <li>Alignment</li>
                            <li>Proximity</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>
                        The site makes use of contrast by using a white background with bright
                        and easy to read font colors, but fails majorly in repitition, alignment, and proximity.
                        There seems to be no repitition, as every image is randomly scattered, making the alignment
                        and proximity also fail to be evident with no real structure to the page.

                <h3><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/">Rolling Stone Magazine</a></h3>
                    <p>
                        Rolling Stone is a world renowned magazine company that has been established
                        since 1967. They currently have over 700,000 copies issued across America monthly.
                        They came to fame by becoming one of the first magazines to cover rock music
                        and have become a household name for the critique and interview of music and musicians
                        alike. 
                    </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Contrast</li>
                            <li>Repitition</li>
                            <li>Alignment</li>
                            <li>Proximity</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>
                        The Rolling Stone website makes use of contrast, alignment and repition greatly
                        by using bright vibrant colors against a white background and allowing
                        a similar style throughout the website with the use of whitespace and grids.
                        The website also makes use of proximity by using headers to keep relevant information
                        close together.
